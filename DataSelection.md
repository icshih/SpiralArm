Gaia DR1 + Hipparcos (and other external catalogues)

We choose the external catalogues whcih are selected to cross-match with Gaia DR1 (as part of first Gaia Data Release). The externals must cover the galactic plane region, so the below catalogues are selected for further study.

– UCAC4 (Zacharias et al. 2013)
The photometry data is from 2MASS (J, K, B, V) and APASS (r, i) 
– GSC 2.3 (Lasker et al. 2008);
– PPMXL (Röser et al. 2008; Roeser et al. 2010);
2015);
– 2MASS PSC (Skrutskie et al. 2006);
